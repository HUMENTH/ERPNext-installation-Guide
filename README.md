# ERPNext-Installation-Guide
## The complete guide to install ERPNext in your Ubuntu (20.04) system

### Pre-requisites 

      Python 3.8+
      Node.js 14
      Redis 5                                       (caching and real time updates)
      MariaDB 10.3.x                                (to run database driven apps)
      yarn 1.12+                                    (js dependency manager)
      pip 20+                                       (py dependency manager)
      wkhtmltopdf (version 0.12.5+ with patched qt) (for pdf generation)
      cron                                          (bench's scheduled jobs: automated certificate renewal, scheduled backups)
      NGINX                                         (proxying multitenant sites in production)

##### Use all commands sererate (One by One)

### STEP 1 Update Server
It is always a good idea to upgrade the Ubuntu package if anything is available, run the below command to upgrade and update.
    
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

It is always recommended to reboot the server once the upgrade is done.

    sudo reboot
    

### STEP 2  Create a new user

    sudo adduser erpnext
    sudo usermod -aG sudo erpnext
    su - erpnext

### STEP 3 Install git
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
    
    sudo apt install git -y

### STEP 4 Install python3-dev
python-dev is the package that contains the header files for the Python C API, which is used by lxml because it includes Python C extensions for high performance.

    sudo apt install python3-dev -y

### STEP 5 Install setuptools and pip (Python's Package Manager).
Setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils that allow developers to more easily build and distribute Python packages, especially ones that have dependencies on other packages. Packages built and distributed using setuptools look to the user like ordinary Python packages based on the distutils.

Pip is a package manager for Python. It's a tool that allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library.

    sudo apt install python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-testresources -y 

### STEP 6 Install virtualenv
virtualenv is a tool for creating isolated Python environments containing their own copy ofpython, pip, and their own place to keep libraries installed from PyPI. It's designed to allow you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies at the same time on the same machine.
    
    sudo apt install virtualenv -y

### STEP 7 Install Redis server
Resid can be used to process and analyze data in memory, this is prerequisite for ERPNext.

    sudo apt install redis-server -y

### STEP 8 Install software-properties-common
Now install the below package to manage the repository, usually, Ubuntu 20.04 has already installed it, but for the safe side, we will run this command.

    sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
 if prompt for "Override local changes to /etc/pam.d/common-*?" on PAM Configuration, then safely choose "No".

### STEP 9 install wkhtmltopdf
Wkhtmltopdf is an open source simple and much effective command-line shell utility that enables user to convert any given HTML (Web Page) to PDF document or an image (jpg, png, etc)

    sudo apt install xvfb libfontconfig wkhtmltopdf -y
    sudo reboot

after reboot

    sudo su - erpnext

### STEP 10 Install MariaDB 10.3 stable package
MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database it provides an SQL interface for accessing data.

    sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys 'https://mariadb.org/mariadb_release_signing_key.asc' #optional
    sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,arm64,ppc64el] https://ftp.icm.edu.pl/pub/unix/database/mariadb/repo/10.3/ubuntu focal main' #optional
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install mariadb-server -y
     
IMPORTANT: During this installation you'll be prompted to set the MySQL root password.
If you are not prompted for the same You can initialize the MySQL server setup by executing the following command
    
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
#### Prompt

        Enter current password for root (enter for none):   (safely press Enter)
        Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]          (Press "Y")
        Change the root password? [Y/n]                     (Press "Y")
        New password:                                       ("Enter new Password")
        Re-enter new password:                              ("Re-enter new Password")
        Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]                       (Press "Y")
        Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]                 (Press "Y")
        Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]        (Press "Y")
        Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]                  (Press "Y")
    
### STEP 11 MySQL database development files

    sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev -y

### STEP 12 Edit the mariadb configuration (unicode character encoding)
You need to ensure to change the default character set of MySQL or MariaDB to Unicode instead of general. To do this you will need to edit the maria DB configuration file which is in this version located at /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d directory so you can directly edit this or locate the folder and then edit the file by typing the below command

    sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf

Once the file opens you need to locate the line where collation-server says general and you need to modify it to Unicode as below,

    collation-server = utf8mb4_general_ci

Modify above as below

    collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

Now press (Ctrl-S) then (Ctrl-X) to exit

And also locate my.cnf and edit the below configuration.

    sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf

Make sure your configuration has the below lines in the file

    [mysqld]
    character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
    character-set-server = utf8mb4
    collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

    [mysql]
    default-character-set = utf8mb4

Now press (Ctrl-S) then (Ctrl-X) to exit

### STEP 13 MySQL Native Password Setup
Now you must ensure that the native password is configured, which will help the frappe framework automatically create the database when you create the site. For this, you will need to login to MySQL as root and then update the root user or the user that you want to use. I will be using root for my installation so use the below commands

    mysql -u root -p        # if this not work try sudo mysql -u root -p
    USE mysql;
    UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    EXIT;

Now MySQL or MariaDB setup is now ready, let us now restart eh service. You can alternatively reboot as well.

    sudo service mysql restart

### STEP 14 Install Node.js 14.X package
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

    sudo apt install curl
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt install -y nodejs

Now it has been installed you can now check the version by typing the below command

    node -v

### STEP 15 Install Yarn using NPM
Now we will install Yarn which is a software packaging system developed by Facebook for Node.js, this is open source, so we will install it using npm

    sudo npm install -g yarn

Now our server is ready for the installation of the frappe environment, let us now dive into the frappe environment installation.

### STEP 16 Bench Installation
The bench is a Command-line tool to manage Frappe Deployments, this tool has various commands, the frappe uses the bench for the command-line tool as well as for the bench directory, so don’t confuse yourself. We will first install the bench package which will be used to set up a frappe environment, create a site, do backup, change the setup, and so on. In short, Bench provides a user-friendly interface to set up and manage multiple frappe-based applications and sites where erpnext is one of the applications.

Now let us install the bench

    sudo -H pip3 install frappe-bench

It will install a bench and will give you a message that the bench is installed successfully, now you can use various bench commands. Starting with the command “bench”

### STEP 17 Install Frappe-Bench Environment using bench CLI
Let us now create the frappe-bench environment. Here you have to decide the purpose for which you are installing ERPNext, it is just for test or training then you can use the latest version, which will be developing and may not be stable. However you can also use a stable version by choosing a specific version, You can search and learn which is the stable version today.

<!--
To deploy the latest frappe-bench environment make sure to run the command while you are in your home directory or your user and use the below command.

    bench init frappe-bench
-->    
To choose a specific version you can use the branch version. I will be using branch version 13 in this installation. You can look for the latest stable release of the frappe environment.

    bench init frappe-bench --verbose --frappe-branch version-13

Now frappe bench environment is installed using bench CLI.

Now you can use various bench commands by changing the directory. So you can need to change the directory

    cd frappe-bench

Once you type "bench" you will see the various commands that bench cli has. Don’t worry, we will not be using all the commands, we just need to install EPRNext but have a quick look at these commands.

    bench

### STEP 18 ERPNext Installation on Frappe Environment

make sure that your working directory is frappe-bench.

Now you need to get the app from the frappe repository, have two options, either clone the latest development package, which is not stable currently, or install the stable package. I have given both options for you to choose from.

To install the current package which is not stable you can use the below command

    bench get-app erpnext https://github.com/frappe/erpnext

I will be installing ERPNext Version 13, for that, I will be using the below command

    bench get-app --branch version-13 erpnext

From any of the options, it will clone the next application into the app’s directory of the frappe-bench directory. You don’t need to do anything with the directories. Just ensure that erpnext is available in the directory.

Now you have the application installed in your environment. The next step is to install the application on-site, but before that, we need to create a new site.

To create a site we will use the bench command as below

    bench new-site erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM

Now site is deployed, by default frappe application will be installed at site. Don’t open the site yet, because we need to install ERPnext to the site.

#### Make sure your sub-domain properly configured to access this server, where you hosted your domain.

If you have not created subdomain, then create a subdomain (preferred) erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM. Then Change DNS records as below:

        Hostname                Type    Value               TTL
        erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM      A       ERPNext-Server-IP   1800
        www.erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM  A       ERPNext-Server-IP   1800

Run the below command to install ERPNext to the site that you have recently created

    bench --site erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM install-app erpnext

it will take a few moments to install the erpnext application on your site.

Now as we created a new site, we need to make sure this is our default site, so we have to tell bench to use this site as default by using the below command

    bench use erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM

Now ERPNext is installed in your server and you are ready to configure it. But beofre configuring there are few more steps in case you want o use this for production.

### STEP 19 ERPNext Setup for Production

ERPNext only supports NGINX, so you can't use apache2 on this server. You have to remove Apache2 from your server.

    sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2 apache2-data apache2-utils apache2-bin apache2.2-common

You can do the following two tests to confirm apache has been removed:

Run

    which apache2

This should return a blank line.

Run

    sudo service apache2 start

This should return apache2: unrecognized service

### STEP 20 Production Deployment
We will use an automatic bench set up for production by using the below command.

#### Automatic Method:

    sudo bench setup production USERNAME

#### Manual Method:
##### Setup Bench Supervisor
In case the supervisor is not installed you can use the below command

    sudo apt -y install supervisor
    bench setup supervisor
    sudo ln -s `pwd`/config/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/frappe-bench.conf

##### Setup Bench NginX

    bench setup nginx
    sudo ln -s `pwd`/config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/frappe-bench.conf

Now you will get a message saying that erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM is on port 80

You can simply open erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM in your web browser and check it will work fine.

### STEP 21 ERPNext SSL Installation NginX

Now your site is ready, you must configure the SSL certificate, I have explained that in simple steps.

First, we will install spanny package as below

    bench config dns_multitenant on
    sudo pip3 install cryptography==37.0.4
    sudo pip3 install certbot
    sudo bench setup lets-encrypt erp.YOURDOMAIN.COM

THE END


  #### Port cofiguration for multiple site
  
  
      bench use sitename


    Switch off DNS based multitenancy (once)

      bench config dns_multitenant off

    Create a new site

      bench new-site site2name

    Set port

       bench set-nginx-port site2name 82

    Re generate nginx config

       bench setup nginx

    Reload nginx

      sudo service nginx reload
      

    Reload supervisor
      sudo service supervisor restart
